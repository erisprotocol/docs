[[{"l":"Introduction","p":["ERIS is a Liquid Staking and Slow-burn Arbitrage Protocol.","We want to expand the limits of what is possible with yield, so we build on any form of yield-splitting ( AMP EXTRACTOR), yield-compounding ( AMP COMPOUNDER), yield-investing (REDACTED).","All our smart contracts are open source and can be viewed in our GitHub."]}],[{"l":"Amplifier","p":["The ERIS Amplifier is the Liquid Staking Product of the Eris Protocol.","Normally when using any kind of staking there is a unbonding period. In the Terra ecosystem it is often 21 days. That means when unstaking tokens the user has to wait for this period to have access to their tokens again.","The next evolutional step is the introduction of liquid staking. It allows users, to transfer / trade or collateralize staked coins or tokens even though they are staked and locked. Even during usage the tokens auto compound and increase in underlying value. To convert the liquid staking token back to the original token, users still need to wait 21 days - called the slow burn mechanism or immediately swap with a usually small markup.","On Eris Protocol when you deposit the [TOKEN] into the Amplifier you will receive amp[TOKEN] back. Eris Protocol stakes the [TOKEN] with our monitored and checked whitelisted Validators and harvests daily the rewards. If the rewards are received in more than one token or coin, we will swap all other coins to [TOKEN] and restake the whole amount again.","You can see the amp[TOKEN] as kind of receipt, with which you can claim your deposit + auto compounded rewards back."]},{"l":"Why use ERIS","p":["When using normal staking, your coins are locked and can't be used for other protocols. To autocompound rewards you will need to claim, swap and restake them, which will create taxable events and transaction costs. That is why ERIS will automate the process for you."]},{"l":"Advantages","p":["APY- Due to our daily executed autocompounding your APY is better than regular staking.","Liquid- Stay liquid, as you can still use your amp[TOKEN] even while the underlying [TOKEN] is being accumulated. Use it for sending, swaps, collateral and have the possibility to immediately access your underlying [TOKEN] by using a DEX without waiting for the unbond period. You can also transfer your amp[TOKEN] through IBC to other chains.","Integration- Even while generating yield, the token can be used in other dApps for collateralization, lending and LP provisioning.","Time- You will not have to worry about autocompounding every day, no matter what you do, where you are or if you sleep. ERIS will always autocompound your rewards daily.","Tax efficiency- In many countries a token swap will lead to taxable events. Using ERIS protocol, you will only swap once into the amp[TOKEN] and this token will increase in value. And when you want to stop using ERIS you can claim more [TOKEN] than you originally deposited. When compounding manually you will create taxable events every time you use the arbitrage.","Monitoring- We are checking and monitoring all our whitelisted validators for governance participation, infrastructure, missing blocks and community activity. We have direct access to the validators teams. As we uniformly distribute our delegations, we also improve decentralization of the network.","Terra Classic: When the burn tax will be activated on Terra Classic, you will still be able to use ampLUNC without paying the 1.2% burn tax, as the tax only applies to LUNC and USTC"]},{"l":"Disadvantages","p":["Smart contract risks","Voting in Governance not possible yet (See Milestones)"]},{"l":"Fees","p":["Deposit Fees: 0 %","Performance Fees: 5 % Protocol Treasury","Withdrawal Fee: 0 %"]}],[{"l":"Amp Extractor","p":["In the version iteration of the AMP EXTRACTOR you are able to use your yield and donate it to differen projects like e.g. AngelProtocol, LUNC DAO Burn or TerraSpaces.

Withdrawing token in amp[TOKEN] again is immediate.","When withdrawing and the underlying asset (amp[TOKEN]) value has changed, you will receive less amp[TOKEN]. But the underlying Token amount will still increase or stay the same for 100% pools.","The smart contract is also highly tax efficient, as by depositing into one of the pools you will receive a LP Token, so it is a single taxable event and the rest is automated.","Initially we will only support our Liquid Staking Derivates [LSD] for yield extraction."]},{"l":"Operator","p":["The project operator has now the possibility to withdraw donated yield from any number of the pools or filter them by the donation amount to be gas efficient.

We want to allow a diversified set of validators without us interfering or controlling delegations. But we do want to incentivize in our opinion good behavior that often happens off-chain and will need some central committee or decision process.","There are different mechanisms for how LSD’s currently select their validators or delegation amount.","Giving power to own token: Some protocols use their own LSD governance token to decide delegations. This de-facto allows the protocol contributors, advisors and strategic partners often to own more than 50 % of the voting power. For us this means a major risk for all chains involved, as external parties will have delegation and voting power over a different network. The bigger a protocol will grow, the bigger are the risks, as the LSD governance token will take these rights from the user.","Using friendly or own validators: Other protocols, while communicating decentralization, are selecting friendly validators or even delegate to their own validators. Many of these deals happen behind closed doors and the process is intransparent.","Allow user to decide once: Others allow users to decide once during the staking process to select the validator (from a curated list). This looks good on paper, but as soon as you add the possibility to trade the LSD, you cannot change that delegation anymore.","This is why we went back to the drawing board on how our governance process should look like.","We decided to implement a 2-gauges principle that can be weighted with configuration.

The user of the Websites is also referred to as “ you“ throughout these Terms.","The Websites provide users with an interface to interact with the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol (as defined below). Among other things, the Websites aggregate and publish publicly available third-party information about the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol. The Websites also offer interaction methods whereby you can indicate a transaction that you would like to perform in connection with the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol (such as swapping one token for another). When used in this way, the relevant Website can generate a draft transaction message which you can independently use together with a third-party wallet application or device to conduct transactions on Terra. Before using information from the Websites (including any draft transaction messages) to engage in transactions, you must independently verify the accuracy of such information (and the consistency of such draft transaction messages with your intended use).","All interactions between users on the Website or the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol operate in a peer-to-peer manner. Users, traders and liquidity providers enter into a direct contractual relationship via the autonomous smart contracts allowing users to create derivative tokens or trade in these derivative tokens, and therefore these users assume mutual responsibilities and obligations. There is no further control by or interaction with the Site Operator (or the relevant affiliate) which had deployed the smart contract. The Site Operator and its affiliates shall in no circumstances be construed as a party to said peer-to-peer direct contractual relationship, is not liable for performance of obligations thereunder, nor does it bear any financial or commercial risk or provide any warranties or assurances in connection with the same.","Using Terra or the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol does not require use of the Websites. The Websites aggregate and publish publicly available information about Terra and the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol in a user-friendly and convenient format. Such information is also independently available from other sources—for example, a person may directly review Terra transaction history, account balances and the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol on a Terra block explorer.","By combining publicly available information with a user’s interactions with the relevant Website, such Website can draft standard transaction messages compatible with the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol which are designed to accomplish a user’s operational goals as expressed through the interactions. If you choose to, you can also publish such messages on Terra in order to initiate token transactions.","All draft transaction messages are delivered by the relevant Website via API to your compatible third-party Terra wallet application or device selected by you after pressing the “Connect Wallet” button. You must personally review and authorize all transaction messages that you want to send to Terra; you are required to sign the relevant transaction message with a private cryptographic key which is inaccessible to the Website. The user-authorized message will then be broadcast to validators on Terra through the wallet application or device and you may pay a network fee to have such validators apply the transaction message to the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol and record the results on Terra, meaning that a token transaction is completed on Terra.","Neither the Site Operator nor the Websites themselves are your agents or intermediaries, they do not store or have access to or control over any tokens, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property belonging to a user, and they are not capable of performing transactions or sending transaction messages on your behalf. The Websites do not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any tokens. All transactions relating to the ERIS Smart Contract Protocol are effected and recorded solely through the interactions of a user with the Terra validators, who are not under the control of or affiliated with the Site Operator or the Websites.","ERIS Smart Contract Protocol means the source code at https://github.com/erisprotocol, which is a slow unbonding arbitrage protocol built on Terra, where you can invest in arbitrage pools that will automatically execute."]},{"l":"2.
