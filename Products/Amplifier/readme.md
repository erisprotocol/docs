# Amplifier

The ERIS Amplifier is the Liquid Staking Product of the Eris Protocol.

Normally when using any kind of staking there is a unbonding period. In the terra ecosystem it is often 21 days. That means when unstaking tokens the user has to wait for this period to have access to their tokens again.

The next evolutional step is the introduction of liquid staking. It allows users, to transfer / trade or collateralize staked coins or tokens even though they are staked and locked.
Even during usage the tokens auto compound and increase in underlying value.
To convert the liquid staking token back to the original token, users still need to wait 21 days - called the slow burn mechanism or immediately swap with a usually small markup.

On Eris Protocol when you deposit the [TOKEN] into the Amplifier you will receive amp[TOKEN] back. Eris Protocol stakes the [TOKEN] with our monitored and checked whitelisted Validators and harvests daily the rewards. If the rewards are received in more than one token or coin, we will swap all other coins to [TOKEN] and restake the whole amount again.

You can see the amp[TOKEN] as kind of receipt, with which you can claim your deposit + auto compounded rewards back.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Increased APY over normal staking
- Autocompounding without any manual work. We also convert other staking rewards to [TOKEN] and restake them
- Possibility to swap out of staking without waiting for 21 days
- Possibility to send between wallets and chains
- Tax efficient, as you do not execute any transactions
- Integration in other dApps like collateralization, lending and LP provision
- Defined set of validators, that we monitor for governance activity, missing blocks, etc.
- Securing the network, while staying liquid
- **Terra Classic**: When the tax will be activated in terra classic, you will still be able to use ampLunc without paying the 1.2% fee, as the tax only applies to LUNC and USTC
