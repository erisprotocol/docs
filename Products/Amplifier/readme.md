# Amplifier

The ERIS Amplifier is the Liquid Staking Product of the Eris Protocol.

Normally when using any kind of staking there is a unbonding period. In the terra ecosystem it is often 21 days. That means when unstaking tokens the user has to wait for this period to have access to their tokens again.

The next evolutional step is the introduction of liquid staking. It allows users, to transfer / trade or collateralize staked coins or tokens even though they are staked and locked.
Even during usage the tokens auto compound and increase in underlying value.
To convert the liquid staking token back to the original token, users still need to wait 21 days - called the slow burn mechanism or immediately swap with a usually small markup.
