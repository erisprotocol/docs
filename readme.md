# Introduction

ERIS is a Liquid Staking and Slow-burn Arbitrage Protocol.

We want to expand the limits of what is possible with yield, so we build on any form of yield-splitting ([AMP EXTRACTOR](./products/amp-extractor/)), yield-compounding ([AMP COMPOUNDER](./products/amp-compounder/)), yield-investing (REDACTED).

All our smart contracts are open source and can be viewed in our GitHub.
