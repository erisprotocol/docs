# Vision


## KISS - Keep it simple, stupid

While there are many protocols going for the App Chain approach, which also has their use cases, we are explicitly going for a DeFi Chain. 

Our home base will be Terra, but with IBC (ICS20, ICS27, ICS31) we can still connect to any IBC supporting blockchain. This allows us to rebuild the DeFi System that once flourished on Terra.

## Central LSD liquidity hub

We believe that having concentrated liquidity for all liquid staking coins in the cosmos universe brings a big advantage to the Terra ecosystem.

Having native liquidity on one cosmos DEFI chain brings many integration benefits for other products. Instead of introducing asynchronous complexities, dApps can seemlessly integrate with any yield generating token.

Any amp[TOKEN] from any cosmos based chain can then be used on Terra.

## RealYield - No BS

No platform token. 

By holding amp[TOKEN] you will receive part of the performance fees collected by Eris Protocol on the corresponding blockchain. So all our launched products on the Terra Network will provide performance fees to ampLUNA holders.
